TODO List
=========

base-128; pretty sure it is borked for large 64-bit numbers; fine for 32-bit though
(to do with when the bits run out; need to reset the mask/shifts)

Bug when deserializing Test3 (SimpleStreamDemo)

Bug when deserializing larger values in RemotingDemo

Unit tests galore

Remoting hooks; annoyingly slow (compared to vanilla, x10); what can we do?

Create WCF demo
had working previously; ideally all of:
* basicHttp
* MTOM basicHttp
* proto basicHttp
* proto MTOM basicHttp
* net-binding
* proto net-binding (ISerializable?)

Add support for 16-bit/8-bit numbers? (byte/sbyte/short/ushort)
Note that since 32-bit numbers can be processed more efficiently than 8/16,
just needs to call the 32-bit variant (signed/not) versions and cast.

Add support for fixed-length (32/64) integers? Need to check spec...

Create string constants for the defined types and use instead of literals in the serializers
